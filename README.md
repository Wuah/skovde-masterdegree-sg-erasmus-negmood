Master Degree project in Serious Games.

This game has been developed for the Master Degree Thesis Project in Serious Game at University of Skovde(Sweden) during my Erasmus. 
The game has been used to achieve the research question described in my thesis:
*"How can a serious game that induces a negative mood affect playersâ€™ intention of a more environmental-friendly behaviour?"*

If you want to know more about my thesis you can download and read the full text at the following link:

The main goal of the game is to induce a low intensity negative mood able to promote a more "environmental-friendly behaviour". The idea behind this project are based on different studies, especially Forgas J articles. 

The game is developed in Unity and used both free and paid graphics assets (by Synty Studio), and that's why currently there is only the executable available. It has been tested mainly on Windows and MAC (not yet available) but i 've never tested on Linux. Players' actions are logged in a file "UserData.txt" created in the game folder.

Feel free to use my game for any experiments or to give any suggestions :D
Please remember to refer this page, the thesis and to send me a brief note, I'm really curious to know how the game can be applied to other similar (or not) studies.

Thank you
