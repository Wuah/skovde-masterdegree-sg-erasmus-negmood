Master Degree project in Serious Games developed during my Erasmus at university of Skovde

This game has been developed for the Master Degree Thesis Project in Serious Game at University of Skovde(Sweden) during my Erasmus.
The game is the treatment used for to achieve the research question described in my thesis:

http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:his:diva-15780

The main goal of the game is to induce a low intensity negative mood able to promote a more "environmental-friendly behaviour"
The idea behind this project are based on different studies, but everything started from the ones from Forgas J. 

The game is developed in Unity and used both free and paid graphics assets, and that's why currently there is only the executable available.

At least, I hope to release some parts of the code in the near future.

The game is tested mainly on Windows and MAC (soon i will upload the file) but i 've never tried on Linux

Players' actions are logged in a file "UserData.txt" created in the game folder when it starts

You are free to use my game for any experiments or to give any suggestions :D
Please remember to refer this page, the thesis and to send me a brief note, I'm really curios to know how the game can be applied to other similar (or not) studies

Thank you
